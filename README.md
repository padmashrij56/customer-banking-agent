## 🎯 Overview

This project simulates a real-world enterprise AI implementation where you'll build an intelligent **Customer Operations Agent** for a retail bank. The agent assists customer support executives by:

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| 🧠 **Reasoning** | Understanding customer enquiries using LangGraph-based reasoning |
| 📚 **Knowledge Retrieval** | Retrieving relevant banking policies through RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) |
| ✍️ **Grounded Responses** | Generating cited, policy-grounded answers |
| 🛠️ **Business Tools** | Invoking tools (product catalog, branch finder, eligibility checker) |
| 🤝 **Conversation Handling** | Managing clarification requests and escalation scenarios |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.10 or higher
- 🔑 OpenAI API key
- 🔧 Git
- 📦 Virtual environment tool (venv or conda)

### Setup

<details>
<summary><b>1. Clone the repository</b></summary>

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd AgenticAI-EnterpriseDelivery-Bootcamp1-GP_Solution
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2. Create virtual environment</b></summary>

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>3. Install dependencies</b></summary>

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</details>

<details open>
<summary><b>4. Configure environment</b></summary>

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>5. Run the application</b></summary>

```bash
streamlit run app/workbook_app.py
```
</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run every command from the **project root** — the app resolves `data/` and `config/` paths relative to it.

## 📚 Getting Started with the Guided Lab

> [!NOTE]
> 👉 **Start here:** [`app/workbook_app.py`](app/workbook_app.py)

The guided workbook is an interactive Streamlit app and your one point of reference for the whole lab. It contains:

- ✅ 9 hands-on activities across 3 phases
- ✅ Business context and learning objectives
- ✅ Step-by-step implementation instructions
- ✅ A one-click Run/Validate for every activity

The exact method(s) to implement are highlighted live from your own file:

```bash
streamlit run app/workbook_app.py
```

**⏱️ Estimated completion time:** 3 hours
